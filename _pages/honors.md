2007 **Fellow of the IEEE**

2006-2009 **Distinguished Visitor** of the IEEE Computer Society

2002 **Most Influential paper in 20 years**
The Best of ICCAD – 20 Years of Excellence in Computer Aided Design, Included in the 20th
anniversary compendium of most influential papers in previous 20 year, titled On the design of
robust multiple fault testable CMOS combinational logic circuits.

2000 **Intel Development Leadership Pioneer Award**
Highest award in 2000 from the Intel Microprocessor Design Group for a logic and fault simulation
system that replaced a hardware accelerated simulator, permitting full chip Pentium IV class
design ( 42M transistors) to be simulated on a single CPU IA-32 machine against defect based
fault models. The simulator was demonstrated as a showcase technology by Paul Otellini, Chief
Operating Officer of Intel at Design Automation Conference in 1999, and by Bill Gates, Chairman
of Microsoft Corporation at Intel Microsoft Workstation Leadership forum in Burlingame, CA in
1999.


1996 **IBM Invention Achievement Plateau**
for patents

1994 **IBM Outstanding Technical Achievement Award**
for development of a new Automatic Test Pattern Generation tool which was capable
of handling a million gate design on a state of the art workstation in 1992 with 128MB memory.

1993 **IBM Research Division Award**
for contribution to Logic Synthesis system. The contribution was on removal of redundancy from
logic as well as removal of false timing paths. 

1989 **Best Paper in International Conference on Computer Design**
Sandip Kundu and Sudhakar M. Reddy, “Design of TSC checkers for implementation in CMOS
technology,” Int. Conference on Computer Design, Boston, October 2-4, 1989

1979 **Government of India National Scholarship**
based on performance at National Talent Search Examination at the end of Secondary School
Education.
